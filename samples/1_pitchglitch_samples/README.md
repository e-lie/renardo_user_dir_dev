PitchGlitch Sample Database

In order to use this database in FoxDot, you will need to change the folder name "PITCHGLITCH" into a number and copy it into the /snd folder of your FoxDot installation.

This samples are especially public domain samples, that I collected searching throughout the net. Furthermore, I modified all to get it ready for FoxDot fxs.
